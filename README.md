## COMPUTER EXPERIENCE:

I Purna Chandra Rao Vellalacheruvu Graduate Computer Science Student. I have completed my Undergrad in Department of Computer Science, I acquired thorough and comprehensive training in computers and software. Quality undergraduate program exposed me to Operating Systems, Data Base Management Systems, Computer Networks, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Object Oriented Analysis Design. I also gained command on the basics of various computer languages and software’s like "C & Data structures, C++, Java Programming, CSS, HTML, HTML5” and operating systems Windows and Linux. I have completed some courses in Coursera like Python Basics, Python Data Structures, HTML5.I have interest on Web Developing for that I took HTML5.Based on my knowledge I created some web pages using HTML, CSS in my Undergrad. Finally at the end of my undergrad me and my colleague did an project on Cloud Computing named as “Efficient File Hierarchy Attribute Based Encryption Scheme”. 

## WHAT I EXPECTING FROM THIS COURSE:

I have some knowledge on creating web pages individually, but I don’t know how to connect collection  of web pages to form a web site. I am impressed by the course description explained by you on the first class. Because of this we get a practical knowledge to do something new in this domain. Moreover I am looking forward how a web server works. Creating and maintaining a web site is most exciting work. Actually I have a plan of creating a website as a project of knowing the educational status of the student from the childhood due to this we can track the literacy rate and I am planning to implement this in my state back home.
